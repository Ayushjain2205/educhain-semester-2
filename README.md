🌌 SageSpace: AI Agents That Teach, Not Tweet!

✨ Inspiration
Let's be real - most Web3 AI agents today are just Twitter NPCs, farming engagement with "gm" posts and generic alpha calls. While everyone's busy building bots that farm likes, we're putting AI agents to work as brilliant teachers! SageSpace transforms these agents from social media farmers into specialized tutors on Telegram - because learning through chat is natural, fun, and actually useful! 🚀
